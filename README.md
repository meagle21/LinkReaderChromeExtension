# LinkReaderChromeExtension

## Introduction

### This project is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to save the Website name and the URL of links that of interest to you. This project works for any and all links, ranging from scientific aricles to interesting images. The extension will store all links in memory until the user has completed their research for the time being and downloads the images. The extension will dump all links into a Comma Separate Value file (.csv) and allows the user to create their own name and store the file anywhere on their local computer. The extension responds in real time to the user to let the user know they have successfully added a link to storage.

### To run the extension, please complete the following steps:
1. Download this project to a local folder on your computer.
2. Go into your Google Chrome client
3. Find the Extensions icon (looks like a puzzle piece) and select it. In this dropdown at the bottom you will see, "Manage extensions" select that option.
4. Eensure that "Developer Mode" is switched to "On" (you can find Developer Mode in the upper right corner).
5. In the top left corner you should now see "Load unpacked" select that button and navigate to the folder you download the project to and click "Select Folder".
6. Now you should see "Link Reader" as an extension amongst your other extensions if you have others.
For ease of access, if you'd like the extension to be readily available:
1. Find the Extensions icon and click it
2. This time you should see Link Reader listed. To pin it (make it always visbible in the Extensions bar) selet the pin icon to the right of the extension name.
